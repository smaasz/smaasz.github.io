# Steffen Maass

Hi, I'm Steffen Maass. I study [Scientific Computing at TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/studieren/studienangebot/gesamtes-studienangebot/studiengang/scientific-computing-m-sc/) and recently submitted my master thesis on _modeling and implementation of electrocatalytic processes with thermodynamically consistent double layers_. 
Previously, I completed a M.Sc. in [Mathematics at the University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/math). 
I enjoy modeling complex problems and implement efficient programs that run on high-performance hardware.
The vast availability of data I see as an opportunity to create more accurate models, improve algorithms, and make better decisions.

When I don't care about the most accurate models and efficient implementations I enjoy bouldering together with friends and support my favorite soccer club Werder Bremen 💚🤍 together with my sister whenever I have time.\\
I believe in the strength of an active civil society united by democratic values 🙌.
